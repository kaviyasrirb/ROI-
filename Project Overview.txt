GOAL : 
Build a lightweight web-based ROI calculator that helps businesses compare the cost of manual invoicing vs automated invoicing, showing clear savings and payback period for automation.
Deliverables:
•	Working prototype (frontend + backend + database)
•	CRUD for scenarios (save, load, delete)
•	Email-gated report generator
•	Complete documentation (README + project plan)

Tech Stack :

Layer = Tool / Framework
Frontend = React (Vite)
Backend = Node.js + Express
Database = Mongodb

Core Features : 	
		
ROI Simulation – User enters business metrics → shows ROI, savings, payback.
Scenario Management – Save, view, and delete scenarios from MongoDB.
Report Generation – Generate PDF (requires email).
Favorable Output – Built-in bias ensures automation always looks better.

API Endpoints : 

Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/simulate	Run ROI simulation
POST	/scenarios	Save scenario
GET	/scenarios	List all scenarios
GET	/scenarios/:id	Get scenario
DELETE	/scenarios/:id	Delete scenario
POST	/report/generate	Generate report (requires email)
Acceptance :

•	Inputs validated & results accurate
•	Scenarios persist in MongoDB
•	Report requires email before download
•	ROI always positive (bias applied)
•	Easy to run locally
